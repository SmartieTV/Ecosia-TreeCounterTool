This program tracks the amount of trees planted by Ecosia, a non-profit search engine (which I encourage you to give a try). You can set a custom delay, in which the counter gets synchronized with their API (works fine when set to once every hour or day). The greater the delay, the bigger the difference between the client and the API. For debugging purposes, a log gets created & updated with every synchronization (lastScrape.txt). It tracks the time (UNIX), the result, the difference between the client and the API, the time it has been running and much more. Since the data is pulled from Ecosia's API, I can neither guarantee its accuracy, nor be held accountable for its results.
Currently working on possibilities of integrating it elsewhere, like with smart home appliances, RGB-setups, etc.
